The Denizen Scripting Language - Paper Impl (Unofficial version!)
--------------------------------------------

An implementation of the Denizen Scripting Language for Paper servers, with strong Citizens interlinks to emphasize the power of using Denizen with NPCs!

**Version 1.3.2M**: Compatible with Paper 26.1.2 and 1.21.11!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Support for versions below **1.21.11** has been officially dropped.

## ✨ New Features
* **Events:** Added support for the Paper-specific event `on player unchecked sign edits`.
* **Resource Pack:** Fully overhauled the logic for the `resourcepack` command to support adding multiple resource packs.
    * Added a new `add` argument to the `resourcepack` command to send additional resource packs to a player.
    * Added `PlayerTag.remove_resource_pack` mechanism to remove a specific resource pack by ID from a player.
    * Added `PlayerTag.remove_resource_packs` mechanism to remove all resource packs from a player.
* **Text & Formatting:**
    * New tags: `<&sprite>`, `<&shadow_color>`, `<&shadow_gradient>`, `<&dual_gradient>` and `<&player_head>`.
      * Sprite usage example: `<&sprite[minecraft:items:item/porkchop]>`
      * Shadow Color usage examples **(!! DON'T FORGET ABOUT .hex TAG !!)**:
         * Simple variant - `<&shadow_color[#51a2ff]>`
         * With adjustable transparency - `<&shadow_color[<color[#51a2ff].with_alpha[254].hex>]>`
      * Shadow gradient usage examples:
         * Simple variant - `<&shadow_gradient[from=#51a2ff;to=#FFF085]>`
         * With adjustable transparency - `<&shadow_gradient[from=<color[#51a2ff].with_alpha[0].hex>;to=<color[#FFF085].with_alpha[254].hex>]>`
      * Dual gradient including Shadow color and Simple color gradients, usage examples:
         * Simple variant - `<&dual_gradient[from=#51a2ff;to=#FFF085;s_from=#FFF085;s_to=#51a2ff]>`
         * Tags `from` and `to` for simple color gradient adjusting.
         * Tags `s_from` and `s_to` for shadow color gradient adjusting.
      * Player Head usage examples **(!! DON'T FORGET ABOUT «!» IF YOU'RE USING THE SECOND OPT. !!)**:
         * Full Face Texture - `<&player_head[Tjtoxshpilivili1]>`
         * Only Face Texture (without surface pixels) - `<&player_head[!Tjtoxshpilivili1]>`
    * Added `.shadow_color`, `.shadow_gradient` and `.dual_gradient` tags to `ElementTag`.
* **Internal Migration:** Fully migrated to **Paper Components** for improved performance and modern API compatibility.

## 👾 Commands
* **Teleport**:
  * An `async` option has been added that teleports the player to unloaded chunks without causing server lag; sometimes there is a slight delay in execution. Details: https://docs.papermc.io/paper/dev/entity-teleport/
  * Added `~waitable` tag support for teleports utilizing the async parameter. This allows scripts to precisely track and wait until the asynchronous teleportation process is fully completed.
  * Usage examples:
    * Async teleport - `teleport <player> <player.location.random_offset[99999,0,99999]> async`
    * Waitable teleport - `~teleport <player> <player.location.random_offset[99999,0,99999]> async`
* **Playeffect**:
  * Migrated to Paper's modern `ParticleBuilder` API, fixing a vanilla limitation where particles wouldn't render beyond 32 blocks from the player.
  * Added automatic handling for the `forced` parameter. Previously, even if you specified a high visibility radius (e.g., visibility:100) for a particle spawned 50 blocks away, it wouldn't display. Forcing the particle now ensures it correctly renders at extended distances.
  * Usage example - `playeffect effect:END_ROD quantity:100 <player.location.random_offset[50,0,50]> visibility:100 forced`

## 🧪 Items & Mechanics
* **Attributes:**
    * Added new `.rarity_color` tag for items, returns ColorTag.
       * Usage example - `<player.item_in_hand.rarity_color>`
* **Custom Model Data:**
  * Updated `custom_model_data` mechanism and property, returns a MapTag of `floats`, `strings`, `flags` (booleans), and `colors`.
  * Now accepts a `MapTag` containing `Lists` of `floats`, `strings`, `flags` (booleans), and `colors` (RGB) for advanced item model selection, while fully retaining backward compatibility for single-number inputs.
  * Usage examples:
    * Backward compatibility - `inventory adjust slot:hand custom_model_data:1000`
    * New format - `inventory adjust slot:hand custom_model_data:<map[floats=<list[1000]>;flags=<list[...]>;strings=<list[foo:bar]>;colors=<list[<color[127,0,0]>]>]>`
      * Simple usage - `custom_model_data:[floats=1000;flags=...;strings=foo:bar;colors=<color[127,0,0]>]`

## 🧹 Optimization & Cleanup
* **Core Optimization:** Implementation of custom optimizations across several internal classes.
* **Tags Modification:**
    * Added new sub-tag `.unsorted` to tag `.find_entities[<#.#>].within[<#.#>]` to bypass distance-based sorting. Use this for better performance when the order of entities in the list is not required.
    * Optimized the `.distance` tag by replacing `Math.pow` with direct multiplication. This reduces computational overhead and results in faster distance calculations across the script.
* **Removals:**
    * The `.scriptname` tag has been removed from all objects.
    * `Denizen ASAP Strong warning` has been fully removed.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
* **showfake:** Fixed an issue where the command would trigger an error message despite functioning correctly.
* **fakeinternaldata:** Fixed a critical bug where the command was non-functional and threw an error.

## ⚠️ Known Issues (Official Denizen problem, not mine)
* `.has_potion_effect`: Currently not working.
