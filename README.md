The Denizen Scripting Language - Paper Impl (Unofficial version!)
--------------------------------------------

An implementation of the Denizen Scripting Language for Paper servers, with strong Citizens interlinks to emphasize the power of using Denizen with NPCs!

**Version 1.3.2M**: Compatible with Paper 26.1.2 and 1.21.11!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Support for versions below **1.21.11** has been officially dropped.

## ✨ New Features & API Improvements
* **Events:** Added support for the Paper-specific event `on player unchecked sign edits`.
* **Resource Pack:** Fully overhauled the logic for the `resourcepack` command to support adding multiple resource packs.
    * Added a new `add` argument to the `resourcepack` command to send additional resource packs to a player.
    * Added `PlayerTag.remove_resource_pack` mechanism to remove a specific resource pack by ID from a player.
    * Added `PlayerTag.remove_resource_packs` mechanism to remove all resource packs from a player.
* **Text & Formatting:**
    * New tags: `<&sprite>`, `<&shadow_color>`, `<&shadow_gradient>`, `<&dual_gradient>` and `<&player_head>`.
      * Sprite usage example: `<&sprite[minecraft:items:item/porkchop]>`
      * Shadow Color usage examples **(!! DON'T FORGET ABOUT .hex TAG !!)**:
         * Simple variant - `<&shadow_color[#51a2ff]>`
         * With adjustable transparency - `<&shadow_color[<color[#51a2ff].with_alpha[254].hex>]>`
      * Shadow gradient usage examples:
         * Simple variant - `<&shadow_gradient[from=#51a2ff;to=#FFF085]>`
         * With adjustable transparency - `<&shadow_gradient[from=<color[#51a2ff].with_alpha[0].hex>;to=<color[#FFF085].with_alpha[254].hex>]>`
      * Dual gradient including Shadow color and Simple color gradients, usage examples:
         * Simple variant - `<&dual_gradient[from=#51a2ff;to=#FFF085;s_from=#FFF085;s_to=#51a2ff]>`
         * Tags `from` and `to` for simple color gradient adjusting.
         * Tags `s_from` and `s_to` for shadow color gradient adjusting.
      * Player Head usage examples **(!! DON'T FORGET ABOUT «!» IF YOU'RE USING THE SECOND OPT. !!)**:
         * Full Face Texture - `<&player_head[Tjtoxshpilivili1]>`
         * Only Face Texture (without surface pixels) - `<&player_head[!Tjtoxshpilivili1]>`
    * Added `.shadow_color`, `.shadow_gradient` and `.dual_gradient` tags to `ElementTag`.
* **Internal Migration:** Fully migrated to **Paper Components** for improved performance and modern API compatibility.

## 🧪 Items & Mechanics
* **Attributes:**
    * Added new `.rarity_color` tag for items, returns ColorTag.
       * Usage example - `<player.item_in_hand.rarity_color>`

## 🧹 Optimization & Cleanup
* **Core Optimization:** Implementation of custom optimizations across several internal classes.
* **Tags Modification:**
    * Added new sub-tag `.unsorted` to tag `.find_entities[<...>].within[<...>]` to bypass distance-based sorting. Use this for better performance when the order of entities in the list is not required.
    * Optimized the `.distance` tag by replacing `Math.pow` with direct multiplication. This reduces computational overhead and results in faster distance calculations across the script.
* **Removals:**
    * The `.scriptname` tag has been removed from all objects.
    * `Denizen ASAP Strong warning` has been fully removed.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
* **showfake:** Fixed an issue where the command would trigger an error message despite functioning correctly.
* **fakeinternaldata:** Fixed a critical bug where the command was non-functional and threw an error.

## ⚠️ Known Issues (Official Denizen problem, not mine)
* `.has_potion_effect`: Currently not working.
